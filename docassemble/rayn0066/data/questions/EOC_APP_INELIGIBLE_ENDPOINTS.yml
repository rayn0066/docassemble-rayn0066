  It is important to pinpoint when the action of discrimination occurred as it will effect whether your claim can proceed or if an exemption must be applied for first.
  
  If the **incident occurred over 12 months ago,** you must apply to the court for an exemption. Please contact the EOC directly by the phone number or email address below for support. 
  
  If you **cannot remember when the incident occurred**, please restart the EOC Complaint Directory once you have determined when the incident occurred.
